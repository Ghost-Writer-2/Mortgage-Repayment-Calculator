## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Input mortgage information and see monthly repayment and total repayment amounts after submitting the form
- See form validation messages if any field is incomplete
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS

### What I learned

I used to opportunity to practice using SASS and I learned how to create a mini CSS library. I learned how to style both the parent input element and it's sibling on focus.
Got to practice javascript more too. Also I think my responsive design skill is levelling up. 

```css
.input:focus {
  /* style goes here */
}

input:focus + <element> {
  /* style goes here */
}
```
```js
// removes default html error styles
document.addEventListener("invalid", (e) => {e.preventDefault()}, true)
```

### Continued development

I want to keep learning more advanced Javascript concepts and also keep getting better at css.
